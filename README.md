# React S.O.L.I.D Principles: Writing Clean Code in React

## Introduction

This repository demonstrates the implementation of the S.O.L.I.D principles in React to write clean, maintainable, and scalable code.

### What Are the S.O.L.I.D Principles?
- **SRP**: Single Responsibility Principle
- **OCP**: Open-Closed Principle
- **LSP**: Liskov Substitution Principle
- **ISP**: Interface Segregation Principle
- **DIP**: Dependency Inversion Principle

Each principle aims to improve code structure, readability, and flexibility. You can watch an in-depth explanation of these principles on [CoderOne's YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/MSq_DCRxOxw).

## Code Overview

This repository contains examples of how to apply each principle in a React application. You can find them inside the `src/principle` folder, with isolated demos for each principle.

### Running the Project

To see the demos in action, install the dependencies and start the development server:

```bash
yarn install
yarn dev
